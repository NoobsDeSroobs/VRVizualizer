# VRVizualizer
A virtual reality visualization system for scientific data. 

In order to build this project yourself you need to do 5 things.
1. You need UE4.14 which you can download from their launcher: https://launcher-public-service-prod06.ol.epicgames.com/launcher/api/installer/download/EpicGamesLauncherInstaller.msi
2. You need Visual Studio community 2016: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409
3. This git repo: git clone --recurse https://github.com/NoobsDeSroobs/VRVizualizer <Folder name>
4. Right click on the .uproject file and click on "Generate Visual Studio project files".
5. Build the VS project and then launch the game using the .uproject file.

If there is a desire for it I can add the binaries for the C++ code that is included and avoid step 2, 4 and 5.
